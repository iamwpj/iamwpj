# Interests

  - **Linux:** I can't imagine life before Linux. At some point ten years ago I installed it on my laptop and it turned into a hobby. Now I run it all day for work, but it's still a passionate subject.
  - **Python, Bash, JavaScript:** Learning how to wrangle a language into a functional tool gives some sort of much needed dopamine rush for me.
  - **Logs:** I've spent enough time doing System Administration that now I have a deep appreciating for a good log and a cluster to store it in.
  - **Security:** Who's hacking me? Who's hacking you? I enjoy the stories and am a keen follower of InfoSec Twitter -- check out my [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1308143905377062912)!
  - **Social Issues:** I don't intend to let the problems that plague our society now continue into our children's problems.
  - **Board games:** I grew up play card games and now I love the more indepth gameplay:
    * Gloomhaven
    * Kemet
    * Just enough DnD to get into trouble
