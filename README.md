I don't read as much as I should and I can't quite remember band names anymore. I do like pizza, but that's not a good way to judge a personality. Here are some things that might help you learn about me more:

  - **Social Issues:** I don't intend to let the problems that plague our society now continue into our children's problems. My B.A. in History tells me that we have made these mistakes before — and we paid dearly then to learn what is right and what is wrong. BLM ✊🏿, climate change is a crisis 🌏, healthcare is a right 🏥, and college should be free 📚.
  - **Board games:** I grew up play card games and now I love the more indepth gameplay:
    * Gloomhaven
    * Kemet
    * Just enough DnD to get into trouble
  - **Cooking:** I started a sourdough starter in September of 2019 — before the COVID craze. Growing up a picky eater, I always knew that food would be my struggle, but learning to cook has expanded my horizons beyond cookies and bread (though both remain close to my heart ❤️)
