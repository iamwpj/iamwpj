# What I'm not about

* ***Work outside of work.*** I don't wish to burnout and I don't particularly feel the need to impress peers in the IT industry with my volume of productive hobbying. You won't see emails from me at 11PM and I'm not spinning up an app every weekend. I will not kill my passion by abusing it just because it seems to be expected by some people.
* ***Cluttering the IT landscape with bespoke solutions.*** I've done my fair share of customized tooling, but if I can help it I always prefer at least an integration with an existing solution. I'm happy to glue stuff together. While I think it's helpful for people as a whole, I don't think the attitude the motivates people to build a new solution when they are unsatisfied with the existing offering is either healthy nor sustainable. Work to improve an opensource solution.
* ***Intolerance.*** Whether it's a new GUI or a coworker with different social skills than we're used to, I don't have patience for a lack of flexibility in your workflow and rationality. You look like a fool to me.
* ***Creating a whole new paradigm.*** Statistics gives me the ability to confidently say that neither you nor I are the ones who are going to invent the SECOND AGE OF COMPUTING or whatever the Silicon Valley VC's are selling this week. I don't ever intend to have impact the world or even a niche component of the world. I don't trust people who's ethos has a brand involving *shaking things up* -- that's like going into a scientific study to prove your preconceived notions.
