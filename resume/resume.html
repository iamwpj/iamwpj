        <ul>
            <li><strong>IPAM migration: </strong>Review and select a product to integrate management of DHCP and DNS. I worked with a small team to evaluate options and choose the best solution from provided bids. Once a product was selected I co-led the
                migration onto the product and helped to resolve technical issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized logging: </strong>I took over a failing single node log search server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment of that service for several
                years as it gained support and traction for the value offered. It has been adopted as an integral service and is being integrated into a production lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Network device monitoring automation: </strong>Create a system to automate, import, and expand our service monitoring of network devices. The automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual process that was not being completed
                effectively. I also expanded the service to enable network engineers to develop custom monitors and use a CI workflow to activate them.</li>
            <li><strong>IT service management platform migration: </strong>I worked with a small team to review and evaluate replacement options for our feature limited service platform. We chose Jira Service Desk to integrate with another product that was
                being implemented simultaneously â€” Jira Software. I served on both teams and helped to ensure the products would be a good fit and the decisions that were made helped to align with IT's goals for customer service. I also handled the migration
                of data from our previous ticket system to Jira Service Desk by creating custom API tooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Web learning application: </strong>I maintained a custom application that allows instructors to teach classes about WordPress, SEO, MySQL databases, and web development for two years before beginning a full rebuild to support Python
                3. I built a new backend layer and adapted the PHP web frontend to be more secure and have an updated look. The backend uses Redis for user caching and task scheduling and has a custom API to interface with directly as well as be the connection
                to the frontend. I also integrated the frontend login to the campus solution.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Telecom system replacement evaluation: </strong>I helped to lead a team evaluating phone system migration options. As an adminstrator of our Avaya infastructure I was able to recognize the weakness and strengths in the implementations
                of different offerings. As this project is continuing to a migration phase I have worked to plan out processes for things likes e911 support, user provisioning, and continued support of legacy devices.</li>
