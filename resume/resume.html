        <h3>Senior Systems Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2022 to Present</h3>
        <p>As a senior, I work to educate coworkers and establish long-term goals with my team, alongside previous responsibilities.</p>

        <h3>Systems and Network Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2016 to 2022</h3>
        <p>I focus on automation to support a variety of servers and clusters. I interact with a broad range of
            technologies and resources to help provide reliable IT infrastructure services at UNI.</p>

        <h3>IT Client Support - Cedar Falls - 2015 to 2016</h3>
        <p>Direct client support for desktops and server administration for a healthcare provider. Through this role I
            was exposed to a large swath of routine business and healthcare specific software. I developed the skills
            necessary to continue my career by working with networking and server technologies such as DHCP, DNS,
            firewalls, and vSphere management.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>Cross-team communication.</strong> In my first few years at University of Northern Iowa, I
                worked with both the system administrator team and network teams. I used the tools from one team to help
                the other -- managing servers with Puppet, securing web access with certificates, creating a development
                workflow using GitLab, and building a more efficient network access control system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Discover and improve.</strong> A key strength I have developed over the years has been the
                ability to discover the "ins and outs" of a system or software. When IT was relied on to take over a
                failing HPC cluster, I was able to figure out how to access, secure, and administer the aging system
                with minimal interruption for the few users. I have since continued to incrementally improve the HPC
                offering by building an in-house solution when the previous one failed, finally, helping to plan and
                implement a new cluster in 2022.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ensuring longevity of services.</strong> Services should be maintainable over time, this
                requires proper planning to assess needs of a project, constant re-evalution during the implementation
                and early years, and up-to-date documentation and monitoring. I have worked on a variety of large scale
                projects that require accounting for a diverse set of goals. I have worked to ensure that these projects
                are successful both on launch, but maintainable and continue to be extend past their initial
                availability.

        <!-- Projects -->
        <h1>Special Projects</h1>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <!-- <li><strong>IPAM migration: </strong>Review and select a product to integrate management of DHCP and DNS. I worked with a small team to evaluate options and choose the best solution from provided bids. Once a product was selected I co-led the
                migration onto the product and helped to resolve technical issues.</li> -->
            <li><strong>Centralized logging: </strong>I took over a failing single node log search server (Graylog) and
                migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation
                deployment of that service for several
                years as it gained support and traction for the value offered. In January 2022, I deployed OpenSearch as
                a <em>near production</em> centralized log cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Network device monitoring automation: </strong>Create a system to automate, import, and expand our service monitoring of network devices. The automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual process that was not being completed
                effectively. I also expanded the service to enable network engineers to develop custom monitors and use a CI workflow to activate them.</li>
            <!-- <li><strong>IT service management platform migration: </strong>I worked with a small team to review and
                evaluate replacement options for our feature limited service platform. We chose Jira Service Desk to
                integrate with another product that was
                being implemented simultaneously â€” Jira Software. I served on both teams and helped to ensure the
                products would be a good fit and the decisions that were made helped to align with IT's goals for
                customer service. I also handled the migration
                of data from our previous ticket system to Jira Service Desk by creating custom API tooling.</li> -->
            <li><strong>Web learning application: </strong>I maintained a custom application that allows instructors to
                teach classes about WordPress, SEO, MySQL databases, and web development for two years before beginning
                a full rebuild to support Python
                3. I built a new backend layer and adapted the PHP web frontend to be more secure and have an updated
                look. The backend uses Redis for user caching and task scheduling and has a custom API to interface with
                directly as well as be the connection
                to the frontend. I also integrated the frontend login to the campus solution.
            </li>
            <!-- <li><strong>On-prem Kubernetes proof of concept: </strong>I performed a minimal three node cluster installation of Kubernetes on virtual servers within our on premise environment. A colleague and I evaluated our team's ability to operate and integrate
                our current workflows into a container environment. We determined it wasn't a good fit and turned our focus to improving core infrastructure so that down the road the migration would be easier.</li> -->
