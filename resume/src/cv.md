# Work History

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## University of Northern Iowa

### Senior Systems Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2022 to Present

As a senior, I work educate coworkers and establish long-term goals with
my team, alongside previous responsibilities.

### Systems and Network Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2016 to 2022

I focus on automation to support a variety of servers and clusters. I
interact with a broad range of technologies and resources to help
provide reliable IT at UNI.

## Aces

### IT Client Support - Cedar Falls - 2015 to 2016

Direct client support for desktops and server administration for a
healthcare provider. Through this role I was exposed to a large swath of
routine business and healthcare specific software. I developed the
skills necessary to continue my career by working with networking and
server technologies such as DHCP, DNS, firewalls, and vSphere
management.

# Conferences & Workshops

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## High-Performance Computing Solutions for Small Midwest Institutions

### 2024 - Cedar Falls, IA

The University of Northern Iowa is utilizing a planning grant from the
National Science Foundation to decipher the ways in which campus can
help to provide high performance compute resources to other similar and
smaller institutions in the Midwest. The focus of the workshop was to
cover some outstanding concerns and establish communications with
partner schools for future collaboration.

## Throughput Computing

### 2023 - Madison, WI

A conference involving high performance computing enabled by the Open
Science Grid project, a collection of institutional research centers
across the country. This conference offered information about ongoing
researching happening on the OSG network research clusters and technical
details for furthering research.

# Course Work

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [Exploring
    Wireguard](https://github.com/iamwpj/iamwpj/blob/main/papers/WireGuard:%20Trusting%20Network%20Layer%20Authentication%20in%20a%20New%20Protocol.pdf):
    a review of the software security in WireGuard and related readings.
-   [Ethics of data
    brokers](https://github.com/iamwpj/iamwpj/blob/main/papers/They%20Only%20Want%20You%20For%20Your%20Data.pdf):
    I analyzed the history and make up data brokers' consumer
    categorization. Put into context, the ethical process of assigning
    user groups to buckets and relying on these for reliable marketable
    groups is a process fraught with complicated assumptions.
-   [Using a CNN AI model to detect generated
    images](https://github.com/iamwpj/iamwpj/blob/main/papers/A%20Naive%20CNN%20Application%20to%20AI%20Generated%20Image%20Detection.pdf):
    This is a naive implementation and method of image trust detection,
    but there are indicates that the technique is viable â€” with proper
    training and tuning AI networks can detect generated content without
    having to build new parameter sets for specific details in an image.
-   [Controlling Kafka data within a
    pipeline](https://github.com/iamwpj/iamwpj/blob/main/papers/Standardizing%20Data%20For%20Kafka%20Consumers.pdf):
    I designed and implemented a service within a Kafka pipeline to
    encode and standardize data to ensure that neither consuming or
    producing clients would have to deal with these processes.

# Specific Skills

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Languages:** Bash, Python
-   **Configuration Management:** Puppet
-   **Systems:** Linux, vSphere, Docker
-   **Workflow:** GitLab CI, Rundeck, Jira
-   **Logging, Alerting, & Metrics:** rsyslog, ELK (and OpenSearch,
    etc), Icinga, PagerDuty, Prometheus, Grafana
-   **High Performance Computing:** Slurm, OpenMPI

# Special Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Centralized logging:** I took over a failing single node log
    search server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch,
    Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment
    of that service for several years as it gained support and traction
    for the value offered. Finally, I was able to deploy OpenSearch as
    centralized log cluster.
-   **Network device monitoring automation:** Create a system to
    automate, import, and expand our service monitoring of network
    devices. The automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual
    process that was not being completed effectively. I also expanded
    the service to enable network engineers to develop custom monitors
    and use a CI workflow to activate them.
-   **High performance compute cluster:** I have operated the UNI HPC
    environment since 2018, consisting of a few different iterations.
    During the initial years, we worked on a plan with the academic
    parties on campus to migrate from an ad-hoc environment that I had
    built with spare hardware to a more sustainable permanent cluster.
    In 2022, we implemented a new cluster and I have continued to
    support it by providing software installation, parallelized
    computing skills, access and authentication, and advisement for
    continued growth of the cluster.
