Work History

------------------------------------------------------------------------

University of Northern Iowa

Senior Systems Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2022 to Present

As a senior, I work educate coworkers and establish long-term goals with
my team, alongside previous responsibilities.

Systems and Network Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2016 to 2022

I focus on automation to support a variety of servers and clusters. I
interact with a broad range of techonologies and resources to help
provide reliable IT at UNI.

IT Client Support - Cedar Falls - 2015 to 2016

Direct client support for desktops and server administration for a
healthcare provider. Through this role I was exposed to a large swath of
routine business and healthcare specific software. I developed the
skills necessary to continue my career by working with networking and
server technologies such as DHCP, DNS, firewalls, and vSphere
management.

Conferences & Workshops

------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Performance Computing Solutions for Small Midwest Institutions

2024 - Cedar Falls, IA

The University of Northern Iowa is utilizing a planning grant from the
National Science Foundation to decipher the ways in which campus can
help to provide high performance compute resources to other similiar and
smaller institutions in the Midwest. The focus of the workshop was to
cover some outstanding concerns and establish communications with
partner schools for future collaboration.

Throughput Computing

2023 - Madison, WI

A conference involving high performance computing enabled by the Open
Science Grid project, a collection of institutional research centers
across the country. This conference offered information about ongoing
researching happening on the OSG network research clusters and technical
details for furthering research.

Course Work

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Exploring Wireguard: a review of the software security in WireGuard
    and related readings.
-   Ethics of data brokers: I analyzed the history and make up data
    brokers' consumer categorization. Put into context, the ethical
    process of assigning user groups to buckets and relying on these for
    reliable marketable groups is a process fraught with complicated
    assumptions.
-   Using a CNN AI model to detect generated images: This is a naive
    implementation and method of image trust detection, but there are
    indicates that the technique is viable â€” with proper training and
    tuning AI networks can detect generated content without having to
    build new parameter sets for sepcific details in an image.

Specific Skills

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Languages: Bash, Python
-   Configuration Management: Puppet
-   Systems: Linux, vSphere, Docker
-   Workflow: GitLab CI, Rundeck, Jira
-   Logging, Alerting, & Metrics: rsyslog, ELK (and OpenSearch, etc),
    Icinga, PagerDuty, Prometheus, Grafana
-   High Performance Computing: Slurm, OpenMPI

Special Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Centralized logging: I took over a failing single node log search
    server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch,
    Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment
    of that service for several years as it gained support and traction
    for the value offered. Finally, I was able to deploy OpenSearch as
    centralized log cluster.
-   Network device monitoring automation: Create a system to automate,
    import, and expand our service monitoring of network devices. The
    automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual process that
    was not being completed effectively. I also expanded the service to
    enable network engineers to develop custom monitors and use a CI
    workflow to activate them.
-   High performance compute cluster: I have operated the UNI HPC
    environment since 2018, consisting of a few different iterations.
    During the initial years, we worked on a plan with the academic
    parties on campus to migrate from an ad-hoc environment that I had
    built with spare hardware to a more sustainable permanent cluster.
    In 2022, we implemented a new cluster and I have continued to
    support it by providing software installation, parallelized
    computing skills, access and authentication, and advisement for
    continued growth of the cluster.
