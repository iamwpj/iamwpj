Special Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   IPAM migration: Review and select a product to integrate management
    of DHCP and DNS. I worked with a small team to evaluate options and
    choose the best solution from provided bids. Once a product was
    selected I co-led the migration onto the product and helped to
    resolve technical issues.
-   Centralized logging: I took over a failing single node log search
    server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch,
    Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment
    of that service for several years as it gained support and traction
    for the value offered. It has been adopted as an integral service
    and is being integrated into a production lifecycle.
-   Network device monitoring automation: Create a system to automate,
    import, and expand our service monitoring of network devices. The
    automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual process that
    was not being completed effectively. I also expanded the service to
    enable network engineers to develop custom monitors and use a CI
    workflow to activate them.
-   IT service management platform migration: I worked with a small team
    to review and evaluate replacement options for our feature limited
    service platform. We chose Jira Service Desk to integrate with
    another product that was being implemented simultaneously â€” Jira
    Software. I served on both teams and helped to ensure the products
    would be a good fit and the decisions that were made helped to align
    with IT's goals for customer service. I also handled the migration
    of data from our previous ticket system to Jira Service Desk by
    creating custom API tooling.
-   Web learning application: I maintained a custom application that
    allows instructors to teach classes about WordPress, SEO, MySQL
    databases, and web development for two years before beginning a full
    rebuild to support Python 3. I built a new backend layer and adapted
    the PHP web frontend to be more secure and have an updated look. The
    backend uses Redis for user caching and task scheduling and has a
    custom API to interface with directly as well as be the connection
    to the frontend. I also integrated the frontend login to the campus
    solution.
-   Telecom system replacement evaluation: I helped to lead a team
    evaluating phone system migration options. As an adminstrator of our
    Avaya infastructure I was able to recognize the weakness and
    strengths in the implementations of different offerings. As this
    project is continuing to a migration phase I have worked to plan out
    processes for things likes e911 support, user provisioning, and
    continued support of legacy devices.
