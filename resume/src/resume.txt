IT Client Support - Cedar Falls - 2015 to 2016

Direct client support for desktops and server administration for a
healthcare provider. Through this role I was exposed to a large swath of
routine business and healthcare specific software. I developed the
skills necessary to continue my career by working with networking and
server technologies such as DHCP, DNS, firewalls, and vSphere
management.

Experience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Cross-team communication. In my first few years at University of
  Northern Iowa, I worked with both the system administrator team and
  network teams. I used the tools from one team to help the other --
  managing servers with Puppet, securing web access with certificates,
  creating a development workflow using GitLab, and building a more
  efficient network access control system.
- Discover and improve. A key strength I have developed over the years
  has been the ability to discover the "ins and outs" of a system or
  software. When IT was relied on to take over a failing HPC cluster, I
  was able to figure out how to access, secure, and administer the aging
  system with minimal interruption for the few users. I have since
  continued to incrementally improve the HPC offering by building an
  in-house solution when the previous one failed, finally, helping to
  plan and implement a new cluster in 2022.
- Ensuring longevity of services. Services should be maintainable over
  time, this requires proper planning to assess needs of a project,
  constant re-evalution during the implementation and early years, and
  up-to-date documentation and monitoring. I have worked on a variety of
  large scale projects that require accounting for a diverse set of
  goals. I have worked to ensure that these projects are successful both
  on launch, but maintainable and continue to be extend past their
  initial availability. Examples of this: Transistion from Samanage to
  Jira Service Desk & Implementation of Jira Projects (2019) and Zoom
  Phone Evaluation (2020-2021).

Special Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Centralized logging: I took over a failing single node log search
  server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch, Logstash,
  and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment of that
  service for several years as it gained support and traction for the
  value offered. In January 2022, I deployed OpenSearch as a near
  production centralized log cluster.
- IT service management platform migration: I worked with a small team
  to review and evaluate replacement options for our feature limited
  service platform. We chose Jira Service Desk to integrate with another
  product that was being implemented simultaneously â€” Jira Software. I
  served on both teams and helped to ensure the products would be a good
  fit and the decisions that were made helped to align with IT's goals
  for customer service. I also handled the migration of data from our
  previous ticket system to Jira Service Desk by creating custom API
  tooling.
- Web learning application: I maintained a custom application that
  allows instructors to teach classes about WordPress, SEO, MySQL
  databases, and web development for two years before beginning a full
  rebuild to support Python 3. I built a new backend layer and adapted
  the PHP web frontend to be more secure and have an updated look. The
  backend uses Redis for user caching and task scheduling and has a
  custom API to interface with directly as well as be the connection to
  the frontend. I also integrated the frontend login to the campus
  solution.
