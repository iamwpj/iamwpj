University of Northern Iowa

Senior Systems Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2022 to Present

Systems and Network Administrator - Cedar Falls - 2016 to 2022

I focus on automation to support a variety of servers and clusters.
Other common tasks involve gluing APIs, databases, and data sources
together with Python and Bash. I interact with a broad range of
techonologies and resources – key components: Linux configuration
management (Puppet), continuous integration and workbook scheduling
(GitLab, Rundeck), log collection (OpenSearch), student learning
servers, Zoom provisioning (ongoing), and high performance computing
(Slurm, Bright Cluster).

IT Client Support - Cedar Falls - 2015 to 2016

Direct client support for desktops and server administration for a
healthcare provider. Through this role I was exposed to a large swath of
routine business and healthcare specific software. I developed the
skills necessary to continue my career by working with networking and
server technologies such as DHCP, DNS, firewalls, and vSphere
management.

Experience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Cross-team communication. In my first few years at University of
    Northern Iowa, I worked with both the system administrator team and
    network teams. I used the tools from one team to help the other --
    managing servers with Puppet, securing web access with certificates,
    creating a development workflow using GitLab, and building a more
    efficient network access control system.
-   Discover and improve. A key strength I have developed over the years
    has been the ability to discover the "ins and outs" of a system or
    software. When IT was relied on to take over a failing HPC cluster,
    I was able to figure out how to access, secure, and administer the
    aging system with minimal interruption for the few users. I have
    since continued to incrementally improve the HPC offering by
    building an in-house solution when the previous one failed, finally,
    helping to plan and implement a new cluster in 2022.
-   Ensuring longevity of services. Services should be maintainable over
    time, this requires proper planning to assess needs of a project,
    constant re-evalution during the implementation and early years, and
    up-to-date documentation and monitoring. I have worked on a variety
    of large scale projects that require accounting for a diverse set of
    goals. I have worked to ensure that these projects are successful
    both on launch, but maintainable and continue to be extend past
    their initial availability. Examples of this: Transistion from
    Samanage to Jira Service Desk & Implementation of Jira
    Projects (2019) and Zoom Phone Evaluation (2020-2021).

Special Projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Centralized logging: I took over a failing single node log search
    server (Graylog) and migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch,
    Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation deployment
    of that service for several years as it gained support and traction
    for the value offered. In January 2022, I deployed OpenSearch as a
    near production centralized log cluster.
-   IT service management platform migration: I worked with a small team
    to review and evaluate replacement options for our feature limited
    service platform. We chose Jira Service Desk to integrate with
    another product that was being implemented simultaneously — Jira
    Software. I served on both teams and helped to ensure the products
    would be a good fit and the decisions that were made helped to align
    with IT's goals for customer service. I also handled the migration
    of data from our previous ticket system to Jira Service Desk by
    creating custom API tooling.
-   Web learning application: I maintained a custom application that
    allows instructors to teach classes about WordPress, SEO, MySQL
    databases, and web development for two years before beginning a full
    rebuild to support Python 3. I built a new backend layer and adapted
    the PHP web frontend to be more secure and have an updated look. The
    backend uses Redis for user caching and task scheduling and has a
    custom API to interface with directly as well as be the connection
    to the frontend. I also integrated the frontend login to the campus
    solution.
