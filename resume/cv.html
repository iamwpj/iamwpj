        <h3>2024 - Cedar Falls, IA</h3>
        <p>The University of Northern Iowa is utilizing a planning grant from the National Science Foundation to
            decipher the ways in which campus can help to provide high performance compute resources to other similar
            and smaller institutions in the Midwest. The focus of the workshop was to cover some outstanding concerns
            and establish communications with partner schools for future collaboration.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralized logging: </strong>I took over a failing single node log search server (Graylog) and
                migrated to a multi-node Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana cluster. I maintained an evaluation
                deployment of that service for several
                years as it gained support and traction for the value offered. Finally, I was able to deploy OpenSearch
                as centralized log cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Network device monitoring automation: </strong>Create a system to automate, import, and expand
                our service monitoring of network devices. The automation was needed to replace a cumbersome manual
                process that was not being completed
                effectively. I also expanded the service to enable network engineers to develop custom monitors and use
                a CI workflow to activate them.</li>
            <li><strong>High performance compute cluster: </strong>I have operated the UNI HPC environment since 2018,
                consisting of a few different iterations. During the initial years, we worked on a plan with the
                academic parties on campus to migrate from an ad-hoc environment that I had built with spare hardware to
                a more sustainable permanent cluster. In 2022, we implemented a new cluster and I have continued to
                support it by providing software installation, parallelized computing skills, access and authentication,
                and advisement for continued growth of the cluster.</li>
