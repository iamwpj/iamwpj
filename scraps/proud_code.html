    <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I find that every project I work on I tend to steer the code in a
different direction. Often this is a response to the project. With
Python, I have this flexibility â€“ at times I focus on functions, other
times Iâ€™ll give data the bulk of my attention.</p>
<p>I used to write a lot of small Bash and Python interactions, but more
and more my experience is trending toward larger projects that involve
constructing an entire back-end using these languages. Either way â€“ over
the years I have written some neat code (I think).</p>
<h1 id="auto-reestablish-api-session">Auto-reestablish API session</h1>
<p>I encountered a service with an inconvenient combination of problems:
it was slow to get all data, process it, and submit responses back
incrementally. I couldnâ€™t batch the problem, but this all left the
interaction vulnerable to the session token timing out.</p>
<p>The process to resolve this involved implementing Python
<code>dataclasses</code> to manage both the connection details and API
session token. This allowed the data to persist and be efficiently
checked before every API interaction. When the <code>expiretime</code>
was reached, a process to <code>_reestablish</code> the token was kicked
off.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def _reestablish(self):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Use this to peroidically re-establish your 
    API Key. During long running API queries
    you&#39;ll end up with an exipred token and receive
    401 errors.
    This check is triggered to handle those.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    if self.expiretime &lt; round(time.time()):
        l.notice(
            f&quot;API token session has expired. Expiration time: {datetime.fromtimestamp(self.expiretime).strftime(&#39;%c&#39;)}&quot;)
        
        object.__setattr__(self, &#39;token&#39;, _token(test=self.test))
        object.__setattr__(self, &#39;expiretime&#39;, round(time.time()) + self.duration)
        object.__setattr__(self, &#39;headers&#39;, headers)</code></pre>
<p>Iâ€™d never worked with manipulating the loaded <code>object</code>
object in Python, but a dataclass can be manipulated with values from
any function that has access to the object. I donâ€™t know how
<em>frequent</em> I will use this manipulation, but it was certainly
useful here!</p>
<h1 id="state-checks">State Checks</h1>
<p>When Iâ€™m integrating data from several sources, thereâ€™s often an ugly
combination of logic that will become unavoidable at some point. Itâ€™s
along the lines of:</p>
<pre class="psuedo"><code>if ( A in set1 and setB ) and not (if A.1 exists and ( A.1 == 2 )):
    . . .</code></pre>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>I had some really problematic code that was causing issues and went
looking for design patterns in Python that would help to manage just
this type of logic. I found a clever feature of Python: <a
href="https://realpython.com/python-all/"><code>all()</code></a>.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s a readable chunk of code from the linked site:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bool_exps = [
...     5 &gt; 2,
...     1 == 1,
...     42 &lt; 50,
... ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; all_true(bool_exps)
True</code></pre>
<p>My real world implementation is a little moreâ€¦involved. Iâ€™m sure
thereâ€™s performance advantages, but itâ€™s also really nice to be able to
<code>print</code> a dictionary in debug logging that would just show
<em>why</em> the conditions arenâ€™t met. I think Iâ€™ll use this for to
create better auditing/reporting during evaluation processes.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>if item in list(self.data.SUBDICT.keys()):
    state_check = {
        &quot;item_id_exists&quot;: True,
        &quot;item_unused&quot;: True 
            if self.data.SUBDICT[item] not in comparision_dict
            else False,
    }
else:
    state_check = {&quot;item_id_exists&quot;: False}

if all(list(state_check.values())):
    l.info(f&quot;Beginning delete process for {item}: {state_check}&quot;)
    self._checkitem(item)</code></pre>
<h1 id="send-html-emails-in-bash">Send HTML emails in Bash</h1>
<p><code>mail</code> can easily submit an email to a configure relay or
mail server and provide some basic features. Presentation howeverâ€¦that
requires some work. There are clear advantages to plain text, but
anymore I really prefer to have a nice looking list/report that I can
easily review. I donâ€™t use emails for <em>monitoring</em> as much as I
used to â€“ instead itâ€™s typically <em>reporting</em> â€“ which should look
nice!</p>
<p>In Bash you can submit mail direct to the <code>sendmail</code>
program. It takes a formatted email message, parses, and handles it.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>(
    echo -e From: serviceA@iamwpj.com
    echo -e To: wes@iamwpj.com
    echo -e Subject: Long running jobs
    echo -e Content-Type: text/html
    echo -e &quot;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        The following jobs took longer this week:

        &lt;pre&gt;$(
            echo &quot;${results[@]}&quot; | sed &#39;s/ /\n/g&#39; | column -N &quot;JOB,ID,START DATE, EXPECTED RUNTIME, ACTUAL RUNTIME&quot; -t -s&#39;,&#39;
        )&lt;/pre&gt;

        [$(hostname -f)] - $(date)
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    &quot;
) | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t</code></pre>
<p>Would produce a message like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following jobs took longer this week:</p>
<pre class="plain"><code>JOB    ID  START_DATE          EST_RUNTIME     RUNTIME
FeedMe 24  2023-09-08T11:35    12s             94s</code></pre>
<p>[feedme.iamwpj.com] - Fri Sep 8 17:51:14 CDT 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I tried to send a plain formatted table in Bash, I canâ€™t control
the plain text table â€“ the email viewer will simply output the text in
the system font:</p>
<!-- 
This has to have a '<br>' tag because of the nature of block quotes in MD.
It's still representative of the email content.
-->
<blockquote>
<p>The following jobs took longer this week:</p>
<p>JOB ID START_DATE EST_RUNTIME RUNTIME<br> FeedMe 24 2023-09-08T11:35
12s 94s</p>
<p>[feedme.iamwpj.com] - Thu Nov 2 11:32:37 CDT 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern is easily reproducible and <em>looks nice</em> in
scripts. It means I can simply drop my variables and subshells directly
into the HTML layout. In the Bash world, I consider that a big win.</p>
<p><strong>The one major detraction here: you cannot send attachments
(<a
href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/223636/can-sendmail-include-an-attachment/507171#507171">wellâ€¦not
reasonably at least IMHO</a>) using this method</strong></p>
<h1 id="shell-parameter-expansions">Shell Parameter Expansions</h1>
<p>I <em>love</em> <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html">shell
parameter expansions</a>. I think of it like the regex of Bash
variables. Itâ€™s ugly, relatively unreadable, but still worth it.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s look at my favorites:</p>
<h2 id="defaults">Defaults</h2>
<p>If you suspect you might collect a <code>null</code> variable that
you donâ€™t want, Bash can allow you set a default:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ var=
$ : ${var:=DEFAULT}
$ echo $var
DEFAULT</code></pre>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h2>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html"
class="uri">https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I use this a lot to manage subdirectories and dynamically specify
either a <em>file</em> or itâ€™s containing <em>directory</em> without
having multiple variables or using <code>awk</code> to parse out
components.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ data_location=&#39;data/folderA/mydata.txt&#39;
# Directories:
$ echo -e ${data_location%/**}
data/folderA
# File
$ echo -e ${data_location##*/}
mydata.txt</code></pre>
<h2 id="replacement">Replacement</h2>
<p>Frequently, youâ€™ll get a resulting variable from an external source
or something internally that needs to dynamically update. This means
youâ€™ll need to update the value within a variable. Rather than
<em>overwriting</em> the variable, parameter expansion can replace
components:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ data_location=&#39;data/folderA/mydata.txt&#39;
$ echo -e ${data_location/my/your}
data/folderA/yourdata.txt</code></pre>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s more, but these just hit me right today.</p>
