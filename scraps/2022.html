    <p>I had a good year. I wouldn’t be writing this if I had a bad
year. You shouldn’t judge your year against anyone who writes up a nice
little year in review like this. Here are some reflections.</p>
<h1 id="on-being-30">On being 30</h1>
<p>I wasn’t happy to turn 30, but I am happy to be 30. I have enough
time out of the way to feel comfortable for the first time since I was
young. I still learn new things, but I can start to see more people who
have always been in my life have either recently stopped that or stopped
that some time ago. Some people haven’t learned anything new in decades.
Others might have stopped and then started again.</p>
<p>I’m 30 and I have the confidence of someone who is comfortable with
themself – so I can share something about the world. I might even be
right! What if I had stopped learning new things though? There were some
people in my life who had wisdom; they stopped. <em>They</em> should be
sharing wisdom about the world with <em>me</em>. I see it now.</p>
<h1 id="on-work">On work</h1>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever had such a consequential year at work before.
I worked on three projects that have taken years to create. I don’t know
if I’ve communicated this well at work, but now as a I sit reflect, I’m
impressed. In my first couple of years on the job (2017 &amp;
early-2018) I looked around me and made some suggestions – here are the
relevant three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized logging should be prioritized</li>
<li>Find a replacement solution for HPC</li>
<li>Evaluate replacing phone system; develop a 5 year plan</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish I could share the “Goals &amp; Accomplishments” notes to prove
this, but I have been pushing for these things for five years.</p>
<h2 id="logging-cluster">Logging cluster</h2>
<p>One of my first big undertakings at work was rehabilitating an old
Graylog server. It was centralizing logs for the networking team. It was
clearly overwhelmed and needed some new nourishment. I poked around on
this issue for sometime – avoiding something I suspect I knew pretty
soon. I acquired some out-of-warranty hardware and in the summer of 2017
built my first Elasticsearch cluster. This pet cluster was
<em>fine</em>, but clearly not going to win any shows. I felt the
scrutiny:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why do we need this? Most of these logs are useless.”</li>
<li>“How can you spend so much time on LOGS when there’s other stuff to
do?!”</li>
</ul>
<p>I was patient and continued to expand where I could. Collecting more
logs and improving the reliability. My coworkers started to see the
rationale. I didn’t have a lot of time to dedicate to the project, but
over the years progress was made. In January of 2022, I finally was able
to build a production grade OpenSearch cluster. It took five years to
complete this project. Nearly immediately after finishing the set up and
migration, a new coworker took on the task of bringing in all of the
missing logs. He’s added monitors and we are addressing things I could
have only dreamed of five years ago when I first drew a diagram of what
a “log cluster” could be. Coming up on one year in, I’m working on
passing the management to the new coworker. I’ve done the hard part of
being patient and learning the tools.</p>
<p>I asked for a promotion after completing this project.</p>
<h2 id="high-performance-compute">High performance compute</h2>
<p>Sometime ago I inherited a compute cluster. It would have been high
performance when it was bought, but alas it had become just
<em>compute</em>. It was woefully out of date and infeasible to improve.
I kept it running, but just at that. Some limited research was being
done utilizing it, but many professors around campus were left to use
their own specialized machines or rely on publicly accessible HPC
resources.</p>
<p>A request came in searching for a solution to using a popular biology
compute tool for a class project. We waffled on this, but explored the
options anyway. Smelling doom on the horizon, the original cluster took
the opportunity to die in 2020. This confluence of events forced me to
implement a temporary setup. It was two old vSphere hosts, some scrap
storage and yet – more power than the previous cluster. A couple of
hooks and the biology tool could handle the classes simultaneous
workload. I had to get cozy with Slurm on the fly, but after years of
dabbling in HPC when called upon, I had <em>just</em> enough grasp to
get it running.</p>
<p>In 2021, we purchased an <em>actual</em> cluster – and this summer it
was installed. It’s small, but for the students who need to learn the
basics – the size doesn’t matter. The new cluster has all the
infrastructure the previous ones were missing. I took all of August and
September this year and built modules and integrated tools. It’s surreal
seeing this happen. Requests come in for things like Julia, R, GSL, and
AlphaFold. I can finally meet those.</p>
<h2 id="the-phone-system">The phone system</h2>
<p>In my interviews for my job (back in 2016), I insisted I didn’t want
to work with phones. I had previously worked with Avaya, and hey, what
do you know, my new job had (a MUCH larger) Avaya deployment. They
ignore my protests and I’m too nice so there I was – working on phones.
If you’ve never worked with black box enterprise systems like Avaya you
might find some of this extreme, but it’s not.</p>
<p>The 24/7 support isn’t typically the safety net you’re looking for.
Phone systems are typically extremely reliable. We’ve had scenarios
where unplugging a USB from a <em>VIRTUAL</em> server causes all the
phones to reboot, but regardless of the stupidity of that behavior, the
phones come online again mostly without any hiccup. The issues you face
are much more…edge-case. It’s finicky to work through this with support
and immensely time consuming. This system is built on jargon, clever
1970s engineering, and coked up managers from the 1980s (the last time
Avaya innovated). After chasing some of this I was looking for something
to make the process of manually managing thousands of users and
extensions more tolerable. I was a fallback on this stuff – so things
sat on the back burner.</p>
<p>In 2019, we spent far too much money to upgrade some stuff and I
began to revisit my previous suggestions that we make a five year plan
to get off this system. I really thought about it. We couldn’t afford to
own this anymore. We couldn’t afford a new hire (or even find one!), we
couldn’t afford the contracts, we couldn’t afford to pay specialized
services to preform the necessary updates. We don’t have enough staff in
the department to have someone doing manual labor that Avaya requires.
It was time to go. I made my pitch again.</p>
<p>2020 reared it’s ugly head. It was time to go. A year of reviews and
we selected the replacement. I helped, but only that. It was a team and
a very hardworking coworker that did the physical labor of swapping
phones and met with every group to build their programming. We did a
nearly daily move of around 20 people for months. That’s the tip of the
iceberg though. If we wanted this phone system to pay for itself, my job
starts <em>now</em> that most nearly all the phones have moved to the
new system. It’s time to tether the floating satellite back to the
mother ship. Every little thing that can interconnect will. Users will
automatically be provisioned, extensions will be dynamically added. We
will watch logs, we will monitor devices. I spent five years asking for
more work to do. What a fool!</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<ul>
<li>I feel like a made a leap in my skills with Python. Something kicked
in I’m using more of the <code>builtins</code> and I feel more fluent in
the language than ever before.</li>
<li>I got a promotion and a raise. I was unhappy about having to ask. If
you’re a manager, don’t rely on your people to ask for promotions. Ask
if they have a timeline or indicate that you’re going to evaluate them
for a promotion, but looking for <em>xyz</em> before going down that
route. Don’t leave that ball in their court. The easiest way for people
to get promotions and raises is for them to leave the company. It
doesn’t have to be like that.</li>
<li>I like what I’m doing. I have found real happiness in doing my work.
I’ve gotten more technical and surprised myself by enjoying that. This
isn’t something 20-year old would have expected 30-year old me to
like.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="on-lasik">On LASIK</h1>
<p>I’ve been a glasses-wearer for half my life, but during Covid enough
was enough. I was tired of fumbling with contacts and my fogged up
glasses while wearing a mask or ALL OF WINTER. I ponied up and got LASIK
in March. I can’t recommend it enough. It’s a breath of fresh air.
There’s a cult of LASIK and I’m in it.</p>
<h1 id="on-friends">On friends</h1>
<p>My friends are changing. There was one marriage and one divorce in
our friend group this year and we couldn’t be happier for both. Losing a
friend to the alt-right and another who mistreated his wife (we kept
her, now happily divorced). I didn’t expect that either of these events
would affect me nearly as much as they did. I am filled with pride to be
friends with people who know what they’re about.</p>
<p>If you know someone who is leaving their spouse after being
manipulated for years, I hope you can see just how brave they are.</p>
<h1 id="on-grad-school">On grad school</h1>
<p>I graduated college with a B.A. in History years ago. I was a social
science education major for much of my college years, but switched to
history towards the end. Focusing on history was one of my favorite
times in college.</p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to get a computer science degree and after years
of kicking it around I just <em>did</em> it. I enrolled in a distance
grad program that will allow me to acquire first a graduate certificate
in cyber security and then a full masters in it. I have to achieve a
certificate first (it’s all part of the same program), as part of a
probational process since I don’t have a CS undergrad. I tell people I’m
converting my History B.A. to a CS masters degree.</p>
<p>School is fine, but it definitely hits different after being away for
eight years. It’s common that people with CS degrees will suggest that
most of your day-to-day is self taught. That’s likely true, but never
fall into the trap of dismissing foundations.</p>
<h1 id="on-a-new-home">On a new home</h1>
<p>My wife and I lived in our apartment for seven years. We moved in
shortly before getting married and started looking for houses in 2017.
We got serious in 2019. We were picky and took the availability of our
local market for granted. 2020/21 housing market changes alarmed us, but
we stuck to our guns. We had a certain type of house in mind and we
liked our apartment. Don’t rush a decision. We bought a house we intend
to die in. It’s from 1929 and filled with original hardwoods and builtin
unpainted details. There’s room for me to work from home too. We walk to
downtown and the farmers market.</p>
<p>It was a good price and no bidding war occurred. Every star aligned
and we painted the whole place, removed a ton of carpet, and moved in in
October. We are happy and look forward to a lifetime of projects. This
is the stuff that makes us happy: well thought out decisions and a task
done well and right.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>It was an unusually good year. I wonder, were my other years bad?
Maybe I was coasting. I cannot sense these things. I don’t subscribe to
some of the belief systems about accomplishing goals in certain time
frames or anything about when life events <em>should</em> occur. My wife
and I have always grown and changed together. I think we have become
wiser and learned to be confident in ourselves. We are not only
individually more competent, but together we are stronger than ever.
Could I have had a good year without her help? No. Don’t get into the
habit of dismissing the foundations.</p>
