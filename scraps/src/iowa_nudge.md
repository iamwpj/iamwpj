# Iowa Nudge

Politically, America is functioning as intended. As expected, extremes of our two party system are unhappy, but the perceptions from news and social media are playing tricks on our reality -- things are mostly fine. I recognize my privilege in saying that, my only defense is that things aren't getting *worse* (even for those less privileged). That's been a pretty standard set up as far as America's democracy has been concerned.

We want a little bit of betterment though. At home, in Iowa, our ways are changing. The state is more conservative than we're used to and the balance feels off -- in a "long-run" sort of way. The political leaning doesn't *have* to affect economics of locals, but it can. What are some non-political improvement projects that Iowa could take without having to address changes in voter attitudes? If an elected official is going to vote yes on a plan then it better not have negative consequences...so what do we do?

## Ideas

> We'll start with a basic (and false!) assumption -- the state or federal politicians WANT to spend money in Iowa.

1. Bridge improvement project. Anyway you spin this type of spending it looks good. Restrict bidders to Iowa-based construction companies, ask counties to cover XX% of funding, give the bids exclusively to friends and family contractors.

2. Build or subsidize construction of electric charger rest stops along state/federal highways.
    * HWYs: 18,20,30,34,218,63,65,330,169,71,59,75
    * There I did half the work for you.
    * Manufacture components in the state
    * State owned power production for big facilities at big intersections (HWY30xI35, HWY59xI80), sell excess power to localities (all nearby cities).

3. Fund regional air travel using electric or hybrid power planes. Encourage state travel for shopping, visiting, and general tourism. Flights from Ankeny Regional Airport to Spirit Lake Regional Airport should be full all summer. Someone from  Ottumwa might not otherwise spend a weekend in Decorah, but for $60 and 1.5 hours of travel -- they might check out the pretty trees and local breweries.

4. Framework for local manufacturing. Another good place for politicians to pat themselves, families, friends, etc on the back. Develop an agency that retrofits abandoned manufacturing buildings in small towns with desirable equipment or warehousing capabilities. The state would be a facilitator in providing the basics for Iowa businesses to pick up government or other large contracts for manufactured goods.
    * In this scenario the government takes on the upfront cost of retrofitting and potential equipment costs with the hopes that after one contract for selected goods is fulfilled another business (or the same original one) will pick up a contract and need the facilities again -- this makes the initial investment more useful.
    * Ex. Printing services for Department of Homeland Security is up for bid, the state offers to fund printing press and a building in a recently vacated warehouse in Washington, Iowa. A business from nearby Iowa City picks up the contract at a cut rate, creating 12 jobs in Washington for delivery of goods and operation of the presses until the contract is up in several years. After those three years, the contract is renewed or a new contract for a similar service is acquired. It cost the state $300,000, but netted business growth and kept a business in what would otherwise be an abandoned building. It also ensured 12 families remained in the state as homeowners tax payers.

5. Fund rural grocery access. Provide subsidies for building and warehousing of grocery goods for stores that sell a certain percentage of fresh produce. This will either encourage dollar stores or gas stations to increase their grocery offerings or ensure that regional grocers expand to otherwise undeserved communities. This could also encourage "Mom-and-Pop" stores as well.

6. Offer grants for community centers to be built. Allow these projects to be controlled by churches or nonprofits in the community that the center is to be built. These centers are for hosting meetings and will contain lounge space with heat and A/C for inclement months.

## Conclusion

Each one of these suggestions offers plenty of wiggle room to allow for general corruption and misdeed. There should be opportunities for conflicts of interest between construction contracts, procurement, or even just violating the separation of church and state. Typically I'm not a fan of this behavior, but of course I prefer that our state work to improve itself rather than just languish. I think taxpayers have long anticipated such skimming and won't object to it in the ballot box.

You're probably looking for some of the moral expenditures (Education! Healthcare!), but those are political. That's fine, periodically they get boosted when a progressive policy slips through the federal legislative branch. While these types of things *would* benefit constituents, it's obviously not political advantageous to fund them so I'm not going to worry about it. This list would look different if everyone in the state voted the way I do, but they don't, so above is the list I think we could do.
