## Picky and Snobby and Wanting Something Good

[I was listening to Stanley Tucci talk with Dax and Monica on their podcast *Armchair Expert*](https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/stanley-tucci). He is someone who is a Good Person<sup>TM</sup>. The whole episode is good and I recommend listening to it. I was struck by a part where they are discussing food, particularly being cognizant of different qualities of foods (59m). Stanley:

> Some guy said to me, he goes — I'm just doing like an interview — and he goes, 'So it sounds like you're a *food snob*', I was like, 'What?! What are you talking about?' How does it make me a snob if I like something of quality? That I understand quality? I don't care if it's like a fucking croissant, or a whatever — or you know, whatever — is it good? I don't care how much it costs.

He describes snobbery as something divergent from a concern of quality or even taste preference; snobbishness is a display of money and bragging. It involves *showing off*.

I think most people know what it is like to have something you have a preference about — something you're picky about! — be misconstrued as snobby. At times this sort of illusion and accusation has given me some social anxiety. I wonder if I'm being problematic. Does wanting a certain thing over another make me snobby? Is it just because there's a price difference? Do I sound snobby?

To combat this I recommend shifting your justification from being **right** to being **careful**. Here's some ways to assess this.

### How much do I know about what I'm buying?

I recently had to explain the difference (and pros/cons) of Scotch tape to someone. She had clearly used tapes before, but never really looked at the types. It's a minimal thing, but there *are* differences. Look at stuff in the store and look at what is in your home! Consult with the internet to see what decisions people are making about things you hadn't thought of. Don't show up to the store without having a plan, especially for groceries.

### Rely on best X for $X.

Work within your limits and avoid creating waste or expensive replacements. Remember it's not about having the best things! Being picky and careful means you have something that is right for you — AND your budget is part of that factoring! A fun note here, there are things that you can simply avoid altogether. If you want to save money on oil changes, but buying all the right tools is too expensive then the specials at the auto shop *IS* the careful option!

### Parameters are dynamic.

A good pecorino Romano can make a pasta shine. My local grocery store doesn't carry it. I don't need to go to great lengths here, for me pasta is still good with a nice Parmesan (from a bag!). I make excellent alfredos and while I *know* they could be improved with some nicer ingredients I recognize that not only do I not have access to them, I also probably wouldn't be willing too add that to my grocery budget. It's not for me. The reasonable improve was making alfredo from scratch rather than a jar; that is an excellent way to appreciate flavor.

## Conclusion

If you have guilt about wanting your coffee ground fresh, don't. There's so many social situations we have to navigate and airing our preferences shouldn't be as complicated it has become. If you find yourself sneering at the person suggesting the new Volvo maybe ask them how it differs from the Terrain first. Of course make sure you're not the one who can only recommend Lululemon workout gear — nothing else would do!
